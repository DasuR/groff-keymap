" Name:        groff latin1/cp1252 keymap conversion file
" Maintainer:  Alejandro López-Valencia <dradul@yahoo.com>
" Version:     1.0
" Last Change: 2004-08-03T09:34:32-0500.
" 
" NOTES:
" 
" This is a demonstration of the kind of abuse vim can handle and the
" mischief you can accomplish without delving into hard code
" programming. You don't need emacs to brew coffee....
" 
" This keymap works with groff and for the default Western fonts
" supplied with it. It should work with ATT ditroff as well because I
" used the old ATT syntax, but you may be in for a disappointing
" surprise in such case: accented characters will be mostly faked.
" This file covers codepage win-1252, because that's what I use in my
" workstation. If you use some sort of Unix, your default codepage
" will be ISO-8859-1, also known as Latin-1.  There are several
" obvious differences, all additions in the decimal codepoints 128-159
" are control codes in Latin-1.
" 
" If you need a different keymap, say for latin2 or cyrillic, you are
" welcome to use these example files as a starting point. As well,
" I'll appreciate if you contribute it to this package in order to
" have a centralized distribution (you are welcome to take over
" ownership, I don't look much at this package anymore!). I strongly
" recommend that in such case, you use groff 1.19.1 or a later version
" because it can handle proper unicode decomposition.
" 
" While testing these keymap files I discovered an intersting
" side-effect due to the way vim manages keymap files. Namely, that
" the _active_ key mappings are those you can actually access with the
" keyboard while in insert mode. If you can switch your keyboard
" mappings on-the-fly, as recent versions of Windows, can, you can
" type several different Western Europe languages by switching
" keyboard mappings at the OS level.
" 
" For example, in my keyboard with an Standard Spanish layout, there
" is no way to access directly an etsset «ß» using this keymap,
" therefore the keymapping doesn't work. That is, I can type
" <ctr-k>ss but it won't produce a troff request \[ss] but rather
" the 8-byte code «ß» as defined in the encoding.
